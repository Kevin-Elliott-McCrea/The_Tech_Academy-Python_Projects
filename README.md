# Summary of Contents

#### Tkinter_window

You will find two projects in the Tkinter window file that are my demonstrations of learning tkinter and the grid system for positioning elements, plus how to access the directory method as well.

#### Phonebook_with_db

The Phonebook folder will contain SQLite operations and the tkinter framework. This showcases some of my ability to use databases and SQLite.
