# Overview

You will find two projects in the Tkinter window file that are my demonstrations of learning tkinter and the grid system for positioning elements, plus how to access the directory method as well.

The Phonebook folder will contain SQLite operations and the tkinter framework.

DjangoUniversity will obviously contain Django, which is used in a MVT structure in a basic application.
